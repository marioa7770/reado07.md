The reading was about Javascript's expressions and operators. Javascript has the following operators
- assignment operators
- comparison operators
- arithmetic operators
- bitwise operators
- logical operators
- string operators
- conditional ( ternary) operators
- comma operator
- unary operator
- relational operator

One really cool feature I like is the  the concatenation operator (+) it joins 2 strings together, returning another string that is the union of two strings for example

console.log('mario' + 'acevedo'); will log "mario acevedo"

I also learned about "functions". Functions are pretty much a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
Control flow on a computer is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run from the first line to the last line unless the computer comes across conditionals or loops these structures change the control flow, for example

if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
Here we use if an else statements, you can see how the code works, the control flow starts from the firstline of code and then iterates checking every line of code until and looks at the if and else functions
